# Analysis of Access to Emergency Funds in Sub-Saharan Countries: A Human Rights-Based Approach
Sponsored by [Women at the Table](https://www.womenatthetable.net/)

## Abstract
Having access to emergency funds is a valuable resource that many people end up needing at least once in their lives. Those who have access to emergency funding and other financial services have the capacity to remain afloat when unexpected predicaments arise, while those who are without this privilege have no choice but to endure crises and simply hope for the best. The purpose of our project is to predict access to emergency funds for adults in Sub-Saharan countries using a 2017 dataset from the Global Findex Database which includes demographic as well as financial information for a sample of individuals within each country. We predict access using a Decision Tree Classifier machine learning model implemented using Python. Additionally, an important goal of our project is to employ a variety of different approaches in an attempt to minimize bias and maximize fairness, particularly when examining the performance for males as compared to females. We aim to establish the amount of bias we have within our model using exploratory data analysis, a baseline model, and a variety of fairness metrics. We have implemented our analysis in a Jupyter notebook where this information can be made accessible to a broader undergraduate audience.
