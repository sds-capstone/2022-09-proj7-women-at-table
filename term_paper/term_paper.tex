% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\)
\abstract{Having access to emergency funds is a valuable resource that
many people end up needing at least once in their lives. Those who have
access to emergency funding and other financial services have the
capacity to remain afloat when unexpected predicaments arise, while
those who are without this privilege have no choice but to endure crises
and simply hope for the best. The purpose of our project is to analyze
the access adults have to emergency funds and financial services in
Sub-Saharan countries using a 2017 dataset from the Global Findex
Database. Additionally, an important goal of our project is to employ a
variety of different approaches in an attempt to minimize bias and
maximize fairness, particularly when examining the performance for males
and females. We also aim to determine how adults in the Sub-Saharan
African region access financial services as well as establish the amount
of bias we have within our models using exploratory data analysis, a
baseline model, and a variety of fairness metrics. We hope to implement
our findings in a Jupyter notebook where this information can be made
accessible to a broader undergraduate audience.}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Science is often viewed as a way to offer trustworthy research backed
solutions and answers. A lot of that research involves statistical
methods performed on data however, what happens when the data and
statistical methods are not as objective and trustworthy as is so often
assumed? The conclusions drawn from the data are biased and unfair, most
often towards minorities and protected classes of people. To contribute
to a human rights based approach to data analysis, we evaluate fairness
metrics on a machine learning algorithm to measure bias. We use a Global
Findex data set which contains financial information about 35 Sub
Saharan countries. Specifically, we create models to predict access to
emergency funds, then analyze the fairness of those models. We focus on
group and individual fairness metrics for the protected attribute sex.
In addition we investigate the data set itself to understand where
potential biases might have been implanted.

Data sets and algorithms have real world impacts on real people. The
inherent bias in data sets can carry over into machine learning
algorithms that are used to profile and categorize people
\citep{navarro2021risk, hellstrom2020bias}. Since data set's are not
collected in a vacuum and often represent the discriminatory
environments in which they are collected
\citep{barocas_fairness_nodate}, we must find ways to make data sets and
statistical methods more equitable. In this study we explore fairness
methods that can be used to evaluate machine learning models. The
``impossibility theorem'' is the idea that not all fairness metrics can
be satisfied at the same time\citep{kleinberg2016inherent}. Although
fairness is complex and there are multiple approaches to make a model
fair \citep{kypraiou_what_2021, green2018myth}, it's important to
continue to question how data and algorithms can be biased and how to
mitigate that bias.

While there have been previous studies implementing fairness techniques
in different contexts\citep{deho2022existing, kim2022information}, we
implement them in an exploratory context meant to teach how and when to
use these techniques thus giving us more freedom to branch beyond a
specific question while supporting previous work about the importance of
these fairness metrics\citep{anahideh2022fair, barocas_fairness_nodate}.
We analyse the data, data collection methods, prediction models, and the
fairness metrics to assess how biased our data is and understand how we
can de-bias when possible.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data}\label{data}}

Our data is derived from The World Bank in The Global Findex Database,
comprising the most comprehensive data sets on how adults save, borrow,
make payments, and manage risk in more than 140 economies around the
world. The data set was created to record various measures of financial
equity and inclusion, with the intention that such information could
reveal opportunities to expand access to financial services and to
promote greater use of digital financial services for individuals who do
not have a bank account. Conducted by Gallup, Inc for the annual Gallup
World Poll, the participants responded to the questionnaire either on
the phone or in-person. There were several variables of interest in this
dataset when creating models to predict access to emergency funds,
including demographic and financial information.

The \emph{Education} variable corresponds to the highest level of
education attained with `Primary', `Secondary' and `Tertiary' being the
three options. Here is the distribution of education by gender:

\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-7-3.pdf}

The bar plot above shows us that there are more women with primary
education, but more men with secondary or tertiary education. Overall,
we can see that there are more men with higher education than women.
About 1,000 more men have received a secondary education and there is
about double the amount of men with tertiary education compared to women
showing a clear disparity.

\hypertarget{economy}{%

\hypertarget{financial}{%
\subsection{Financial}\label{financial}}

From the financial related variables, we were most interested in a few
specific financial variables that we thought would have an impact on
access to emergency funds.

\hypertarget{account_fin}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{account\_fin}}{account\_fin}}\label{account_fin}}

The first variable being \emph{account\_fin} which distinguishes those
who have a financial account from those who don't:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# barplot of number of people who have a bank account}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-7.pdf}

We can see that about two thirds of individuals do not have an account.
This is likely connected to the lack of access to emergency funds
displayed above given that if an individual does not have a financial
account, we would expect they are less likely to have a source of
emergency funds, as emergency funds are generally stored in an account.

\hypertarget{reason}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{reason}}{reason}}\label{reason}}

Those who do not have a financial account were asked why in the
\emph{reason} variable, that provides a list of possible reasons for not

To explore access to emergency funds in our dataset, we were interested
3 variables we thought could be related:

\hypertarget{has_access}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{has\_access}}{has\_access}}\label{has_access}}

The variable \emph{has\_access} directly asks participants if they have
access to emergency funds:

the data do not have access.

\hypertarget{main_source_funds}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{main\_source\_funds}}{main\_source\_funds}}\label{main_source_funds}}

We proceeded to explore the source of emergency funds using the
\emph{main\_source\_funds} variable, which provides a list of options

their savings.

\hypertarget{recieve-wage-payments}{%

Diving further into the ``Money from Working'' category, we can see that
only 8196 individuals receive wage payments from the \emph{Receive Wage

In the side-by-side barplots above, we can see that although only about
50\% of the countries have a higher percentage of men represented in the
questionnaire (left bar plot), in 75\% of the countries more men have
access to emergency funds than women (right bar plot).

Additionally, in the barplot above we can see the distribution of funds
based on an individual's highest education level. 63\% of people with
only a primary education do not have access to emergency funds compared
to 37\% of people who do. These numbers are more evenly distributed for
those with secondary education, with about 49\% of people not having
access to emergency funds, while 51\% of people do have access. Finally,
for those with a tertiary level of education we can see that about 72\%
of people have access to emergency funds while only 28\% of that group
does not have access. Overall, we can make the assumption that people
with a higher level of education are more likely to have access to
emergency funds.
