\abstract{Having access to emergency funds is a valuable resource that
many people end up needing at least once in their lives. Those who have
access to emergency funding and other financial services have the
capacity to remain afloat when unexpected predicaments arise, while
those who are without this privilege have no choice but to endure crises
and simply hope for the best. The purpose of our project is to analyze
the access adults have to emergency funds and financial services in
Sub-Saharan countries using a 2017 dataset from the Global Findex
Database. Additionally, an important goal of our project is to employ a
variety of different approaches in an attempt to minimize bias and
maximize fairness, particularly when examining the performance for males
and females. We also aim to determine how adults in the Sub-Saharan
African region access financial services as well as establish the amount
of bias we have within our models using exploratory data analysis, a
baseline model, and a variety of fairness metrics. We hope to implement
our findings in a Jupyter notebook where this information can be made
accessible to a broader undergraduate audience.}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Science is often viewed as a way to offer trustworthy research backed
solutions and answers. A lot of that research involves statistical
methods performed on data however, what happens when the data and
statistical methods are not as objective and trustworthy as is so often
assumed? The conclusions drawn from the data are biased and unfair, most
often towards minorities and protected classes of people. To contribute
to a human rights based approach to data analysis, we evaluate fairness
metrics on a machine learning algorithm to measure bias. We use a Global
Findex data set which contains financial information about 35 Sub
Saharan countries. Specifically, we create models to predict access to
emergency funds, then analyze the fairness of those models. We focus on
group and individual fairness metrics for the protected attribute sex.
In addition we investigate the data set itself to understand where
potential biases might have been implanted.

Data sets and algorithms have real world impacts on real people. The
inherent bias in data sets can carry over into machine learning
algorithms that are used to profile and categorize people
\citep{navarro2021risk, hellstrom2020bias}. Since data set's are not
collected in a vacuum and often represent the discriminatory
environments in which they are collected
\citep{barocas_fairness_nodate}, we must find ways to make data sets and
statistical methods more equitable. In this study we explore fairness
methods that can be used to evaluate machine learning models. The
``impossibility theorem'' is the idea that not all fairness metrics can
be satisfied at the same time\citep{kleinberg2016inherent}. Although
fairness is complex and there are multiple approaches to make a model
fair \citep{kypraiou_what_2021, green2018myth}, it's important to
continue to question how data and algorithms can be biased and how to
mitigate that bias.

While there have been previous studies implementing fairness techniques
in different contexts\citep{deho2022existing, kim2022information}, we
implement them in an exploratory context meant to teach how and when to
use these techniques thus giving us more freedom to branch beyond a
specific question while supporting previous work about the importance of
these fairness metrics\citep{anahideh2022fair, barocas_fairness_nodate}.
We analyse the data, data collection methods, prediction models, and the
fairness metrics to assess how biased our data is and understand how we
can de-bias when possible.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data}\label{data}}

Our data is derived from The World Bank in The Global Findex Database,
comprising the most comprehensive data sets on how adults save, borrow,
make payments, and manage risk in more than 140 economies around the
world. The data set was created to record various measures of financial
equity and inclusion, with the intention that such information could
reveal opportunities to expand access to financial services and to
promote greater use of digital financial services for individuals who do
not have a bank account. Conducted by Gallup, Inc for the annual Gallup
World Poll, the participants responded to the questionnaire either on
the phone or in-person. There were several variables of interest in this
dataset when creating models to predict access to emergency funds,
including demographic and financial information. For this analysis, we
are using only a subset of the data including countries in the
Sub-Saharan region (35 countries total). Our data set includes 35000
observations and 105 variables in total.

\hypertarget{demographics}{%
\subsection{Demographics}\label{demographics}}

\hypertarget{gender}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{gender}}{gender}}\label{gender}}

The variable \emph{gender} distinguishes gender. There are 16,716 males
in this dataset and 17,388 females. This is a fairly equal distribution
that we can see in the graph below.

\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{education}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Education}}{Education}}\label{education}}

The \emph{Education} variable corresponds to the highest level of
education attained with `Primary', `Secondary' and `Tertiary' being the
three options. Here is the distribution of education by gender:

\begin{center}\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-7-3} \end{center}

The bar plot above shows us that there are more women with primary
education, but more men with secondary or tertiary education. Overall,
we can see that there are more men with higher education than women.
About 1,000 more men have received a secondary education and there is
about double the amount of men with tertiary education compared to women
showing a clear disparity.

\hypertarget{economy}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{economy}}{economy}}\label{economy}}

The final demographic variable of interest is the \emph{economy}
variable that separates respondents by which country they live in. There
are 35 different countries from Sub-Saharan Africa with exactly 1000
respondents from each.

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{financial}{%
\subsection{Financial}\label{financial}}

From the financial related variables, we were most interested in a few
specific financial variables that we thought would have an impact on
access to emergency funds.

\hypertarget{account_fin}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{account\_fin}}{account\_fin}}\label{account_fin}}

The first variable being \emph{account\_fin} which distinguishes those
who have a financial account from those who don't:

\begin{center}\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-5} \end{center}

We can see that about two thirds of individuals do not have an account.
This is likely connected to the lack of access to emergency funds
displayed above given that if an individual does not have a financial
account, we would expect they are less likely to have a source of
emergency funds, as emergency funds are generally stored in an account.

\hypertarget{reason}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{reason}}{reason}}\label{reason}}

Those who do not have a financial account were asked why in the
\emph{reason} variable, that provides a list of possible reasons for not
having a financial account:

\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-11-7.pdf}

\hypertarget{emp_in}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{emp\_in}}{emp\_in}}\label{emp_in}}

Employment status was another financial variable of interest represented
by \emph{emp\_in}, which asks whether or not the participant is in the
workforce. It appears that about three-fourths of individuals are in the
workforce:

\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-12-9.pdf}

\hypertarget{inc_q}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{inc\_q}}{inc\_q}}\label{inc_q}}

And lastly, we evaluated \emph{inc\_q}, which represents income
quantile. Income quantile is separated into 5 quantiles with 1 being the
poorest and 5 being the richest. The mean for all of the countries in
the dataset is 3.241. This means that all the countries average out to
be about middle class.

\begin{verbatim}
## 3.241085714285714
\end{verbatim}

The majority of the data set has individuals within the richest
quantile, Quantile 5.

\hypertarget{emergency-funds}{%
\subsection{Emergency Funds}\label{emergency-funds}}

To explore access to emergency funds in our dataset, we were interested
3 variables we thought could be related:

\hypertarget{has_access}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{has\_access}}{has\_access}}\label{has_access}}

The variable \emph{has\_access} directly asks participants if they have
access to emergency funds, with ``emergency funds'' defined as 1/20th of
the GNI (gross national income) per capita for the country. GNI per
capita is the country's total income in a year/ the country's population
size. For context, in the United States, ``emergency funds'' would be
defined as about \$3,000.

\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-14-11.pdf}

The barchart above displays the overall distribution of access to
emergency funds. We can see that over half of individuals represented in
the data do not have access.

\hypertarget{main_source_funds}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{main\_source\_funds}}{main\_source\_funds}}\label{main_source_funds}}

We proceeded to explore the source of emergency funds using the
\emph{main\_source\_funds} variable, which provides a list of options
for where participants receive their main source of emergency funds:

\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-15-13.pdf}

The barchart above displays the overall distribution of the main source
of emergency funds. Most of the individuals with access to emergency
funds receive their funding from work, their family and friends, or
their savings.

\hypertarget{recieve-wage-payments}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Recieve Wage
Payments}}{Recieve Wage Payments}}\label{recieve-wage-payments}}

Diving further into the ``Money from Working'' category, we can see that
only 8196 individuals receive wage payments from the \emph{Receive Wage
Payments} variable. This analysis suggests that receiving wage payments
may be a key factor in determining access to emergency funds.

\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-16-15.pdf}

\hypertarget{gender-economy-and-education-in-relation-to-emergency-funds}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{gender}, \emph{economy} and
\emph{Education} in relation to Emergency
Funds}{gender, economy and Education in relation to Emergency Funds}}\label{gender-economy-and-education-in-relation-to-emergency-funds}}

Finally, we sought to find if there were disparities in access to
emergency funds by \emph{gender}, \emph{economy}, and \emph{Education}.

\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-18-17.pdf}

\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-19-19.pdf}

In the side-by-side barplots above, we can see that although only about
50\% of the countries have a higher percentage of men represented in the
questionnaire (left bar plot), in 75\% of the countries more men have
access to emergency funds than women (right bar plot).

\begin{verbatim}
## <string>:1: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: The resize_event function was deprecated in Matplotlib 3.6 and will be removed two minor releases later. Use callbacks.process('resize_event', ResizeEvent(...)) instead.
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{term_paper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-21-21.pdf}

Additionally, in the barplot above we can see the distribution of funds
based on an individual's highest education level. 63\% of people with
only a primary education do not have access to emergency funds compared
to 37\% of people who do. These numbers are more evenly distributed for
those with secondary education, with about 49\% of people not having
access to emergency funds, while 51\% of people do have access. Finally,
for those with a tertiary level of education we can see that about 72\%
of people have access to emergency funds while only 28\% of that group
does not have access. Overall, we can make the assumption that people
with a higher level of education are more likely to have access to
emergency funds.

\section{Materials and Methods}\label{materials-and-methods}}

\hypertarget{metrics}{%
\subsection{Metrics}\label{metrics}}

Fairness metrics are a way to assess machine learning algorithms for
unwanted bias. Algorithms can classify people unfairly using data
collected in a biased environment. When classifying people, it's
important to understand how these classifications can contribute to and
reinforce discriminatory social systems. Accuracy shouldn't always be
prioritized. It is useful to sacrifice accuracy in favor of fairness
when using machine learning algorithms to make decisions impacting
people.To assess fairness and accuracy in our model we explore 12
different metrics, 10 of which are fairness metrics. Fairness metrics
can be split into group and individual metrics.

Group fairness metrics ensure parity between privileged and unprivileged
groups of a protected class. For example, for the protected class sex,
the privileged group is men and the unprivileged group is women. The
model should work similarly for both of these groups and not favor the
privileged group. Group fairness metrics measures how discriminatory the
model classifies the unprivileged
group\citep{binns2020apparent, mehrabi2021survey, caton2020fairness}.
The group metrics we explore include statistical parity difference,
equal opportunity difference, disparate impact,precision score
difference, general entropy difference,and conditional demographic
parity.Not all group fairness metrics can be satisfied at the same time.
For example equal opportunity difference and statistical parity
difference cannot be simultaneously accounted
for\citep{kypraiou_what_2021}.

Individual fairness metrics measure how similarly the model predicts for
similar observations. Will two very similar people receive the same
classification? Individual fairness metrics contradict group fairness
metrics. When accounting for imbalanced predictions between groups, the
within group fairness can suffer\citep{kypraiou_what_2021}. In the
process of satisfying group metrics, two similar subjects only differing
by sex, may be classified differently
\citep{binns2020apparent, mehrabi2021survey, caton2020fairness, zhou2022bias}.
The individual metrics we explore are general entropy error and
consistency score. We can measure both individual and group fairness
with the between group general entropy error metric.

What happens when we remove the sensitive attributes in our data and
then run the model? Will the model still be biased against protected
groups? In most cases, no. There are often variables that remain in the
data that act as pseudo substitutes for the protected attribute
\citep{zhou2022bias}. For example, if race was excluded from the model
but the variable zip code remained. Zip code can act as a stand in for
race in regions where people are segregated by race.

In our case we are focusing on the protected attribute gender. The other
variables in this data set are education, age, and all the financial
variables. If any of these variables are segregated by gender, by
inherit gender bias in society, then simply removing the gender variable
wont solve anything.

\textbf{Accuracy} Accuracy is a measure of how many classifications our
model predicts correctly compared to all the predictions. The ratio of
correctly predicted classifications to all the predictions. Accuracy
cannot tell us if the predictions are equally correct across positives
and negatives \citep{juba2019precision, gupta2021recall}. 55\% of the
people in our data set don't have access to emergency funds. As long as
our model predicts negatives more than half the time, we can get a good
accuracy. However, our model will lose the ability to accurately predict
positives. It is important to consider accuracy along with precision and
recall so we can more fully understand how our model is classifying
people.

\(Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / (True Positives + True Negatives + False Positives + False Negatives)\)

\textbf{Precision} Precision is a measure of how accurately a model
predicts positive outcomes.The ratio of correctly predicted positives to
all predicted positives. With high precision rates, we have low false
positive rates \citep{juba2019precision, gupta2021recall}.

\(Precision = true positives / (true positives + false positives)\)

\textbf{Recall} Recall is a measure of how accurately a model predicts
negative outcomes.The ratio of correctly predicted negatives to all
predicted negatives\citep{gupta2021recall}

\(Recall = true negatives / all negatives)\)

\textbf{Statistical Parity Difference} This metric computes the
difference in percentages between the ``privileged'' and
``non-privileged'' group of individuals who were predicted to have the
desired outcome. In this case, it is essentially

(\% of females who were predicted to have access to emergency funds) -
(\% of males who were predicted to have access to emergency funds)

The ``ideal'' value is 0 because if we define fairness as statistical
parity, the goal would be for the percentages to be equal for both
groups. If the value is negative, that means that the percentage of
individuals with the positive outcome is higher for the privileged group
(males), implying that the model is biased in favor of the privileged
group. Conversely, if the value is positive, the model is biased in
favor of the unprivileged group. The acceptable range in which the model
is considered fair is between -0.1 to 0.1 (with percentages expressed as
decimals, e.g.~0.1 = 10\%). It is important to note that this metric is
solely focused on making the percentage of \emph{predicted} favorable
outcomes equal across groups and does not take into account the accuracy
of the predictions at all.\citep{caton2020fairness, kypraiou_what_2021}

Relating to our data, this metric will tell us if our model predicts
that men have more access to emergency funds than women. In our data,
men in fact do have more access to emergency funds than women. 51\% of
men have access to emergency funds while only 38.2\% of women have
access to emergency funds. When using this metric to asses our model the
interpretation depends on the context. If this model is being used to
decide how to allocate emergency funds, we might not want to prioritize
satisfying this metric. We are using this model in an educational and
exploratory manner, so we will use techniques to account for this
metric.

\textbf{Equal Opportunity Difference} This metric is similar to
statistical parity in that it is also a group fairness metric, but it is
different in that it takes into account accuracy of the model in
addition to equalizing outcomes across groups. Instead of measuring the
simple differences in percentages between groups of individuals with the
(predicted)positive outcome, it measures the difference in percentages
of \emph{accurately identified} individuals with positive outcomes
(i.e.~true positives). Essentially, the calculation is the same as for
statistical parity, but only taking into account true positives for each
group. Again, the ``ideal'' value is 0 with negative values indicating
bias in favor of the privileged group, and the fairness range is -0.1 to
-0.1 \citep{caton2020fairness}.

This metric helps us answer if our model predicts positives with more
accuracy for men than women. Are men more accurately predicted to have
access to emergency funds than women?

\textbf{Disparate Impact} The disparate impact metric measures the
proportion of positive outcomes between an unprivileged group and a
privileged group. It is usually assessed when predicting an outcome that
disproportionately affects a sub population. For example, hiring more
men than women as construction workers on the basis of height and
strength.For this case we want to know the proportion of females that
are categorized as having access to emergency funds VS males who are
categorized as having access to emergency funds.The standard for
satisfying this metric is that the unprivileged group must receive a
positive outcome at a ratio of 4:5 to the privileged group. As long as
females are classified as having access to emergency funds no less than
around 80\% of the time males are categorized as having access to
emergency funds, then our model satisfies this
metric.\citep{caton2020fairness} This metric is similar to statistical
parity except it measures a ratio which can be useful for legal
purposes.
\(P(\hat{Y}=unprivilegedPositivePredicted) /P(\hat{Y}=privilegedPositivePredicted)\)

A similar problem arises when assessing this metric as statistical
parity.In reality women have less access to emergency funds than men. If
we manipulate our model to satisfy this metric, we will falsely predict
that women have access to emergency funds when they don't. This could be
more harmful than not satisfying this metric.

\textbf{Conditional Demographic Disparity}

Statistical parity difference and equal opportunity difference both
measure positive outcomes. The conditional demographic disparity
measures negative outcomes. Demographic Disparity is a metric that
examines how disadvantaged groups compare to advantaged groups for
negative outcomes from the model.This metric checks if a subpopulation
is classified with a negative outcome more than a positive outcome. Are
females classified as not having access to emergency funds more often
than men? Looking at the entire data set, women have less access than
men to emergency funds. Predicting more negative outcomes for women than
men is not necessarily a bad thing. We want to know if someone doesn't
have access to emergency funds so that they can potentially be helped.

Sometimes when we split data into categories we can find patterns that
don't exist when the data is combined. This is called Simpsons paradox
\citep{mehrabi2021survey}. We can see this in our confusion matrices.
When our data is split by gender there are different prediction rates
than the entire model. The true negative rates are heavily weighted by
females, and the true positive rates are weighted towards males. Is this
the Simpsons paradox or does gender split the data into different
distributions? The Conditional Demographic Disparity metric accounts for
the Simpsons paradox to confirm true differences or no differences in
negative outcomes in the model.

The range of scores for this metric is from -1 to 1. In general a
positive value means that the model is more unfair towards the
unprivileged group. A value of zero is ideal. In our case, if our model
were to predict an equal proportion of negative and positive outcomes
for men and women, our model would realistically be unfair to women.
Women do have less access to emergency funds and predicting that men and
women equally don't have access to emergency funds might put women at a
greater disadvantage if a relief program were to be put in place.
However, if assessing financial stability between men and women we would
be more concerned with satisfying this metric.

\textbf{General Entropy Error} This metric is an individual metric
rather than a group metric, and it computes fairness by computing the
level of unfair benefit being assigned by the model. The metric defines
``benefit'' as follows: for any individual in the testing data set, that
individual has received a benefit if the model predicted the favorable
outcome when the truth was that the individual did not have the
favorable outcome (i.e.~a false positive). Each individual in the data
receives either a 2 (benefit, false positive), a 1 (no benefit, correct
prediction), or 0 (no benefit, false negative). The metric then compares
the benefit of each individual to the average accuracy and false
positive level of the model. The ``ideal'' value is 0, and a higher
number indicates a higher level of inequity in benefit among
individuals. In other words, if many individuals have a benefit score
that is far off from the average, that indicates that the model is
unfairly benefiting some individuals and not others. This metric does
not consider privileged versus unprivileged groups, and thus is not able
to indicate whether or not the inequality in benefit is systematic in
any particular way (i.e., it cannot tell whether males receive more
benefit than females; it can only tell that some individuals receive
higher benefits than
others)\citep{caton2020fairness, kypraiou_what_2021}.

This metric is important to our data because a false positive
outcome(higher benefit) would mean that someone is predicted to having
access to emergency funds when they don't. If there is a high general
entropy error, there are many individuals who's need for emergency funds
are being overlooked.

\textbf{General Entropy Error Difference} The general entropy error
cannot tell whether males receive more benefit than females so we
calculate the general entropy error difference between males and
females. Do men ``benefit'' from our model more i.e does our model
predict more accurate and false positives for men than women? Again the
interpretation of this metric will depend on the context. A higher score
is given for false positives, but this means a group of people are being
predicted to have emergency funds when they don't. It is not necessarily
a good thing for any group to ``benefit'' from our model. A value of 0
represents no difference.

\textbf{Between Group Generalized Entropy Error} We explored generalized
entropy error and how it differs for males and females. Using the
between group generalized error metric we will be able to see if the
between group unfairness or the individual unfairness dominates. Is
there truly a difference in generalized entropy error between men and
women or is the general entropy error not due to gender inequality. Is
our model unfairly benefiting individuals based on sub populations or is
the inequity equal between groups and differs at the individual level?

We don't want generalized entropy error in our model, but it would be
better to have it at the individual level than the group level. We don't
want either men or women to have more generalized entropy error than the
other. If the error is equally within the groups, then both men and
women are at a similar ``benefit'' to each other.

\textbf{Consistency Score} Are similar people treated similarly. Is our
model consistent in the way it classifies people as having access to
emergency funds? This metric alone wont tell us if our model is fair but
we can see how different groups of people are generally treated. We
split the consistency score by gender and we can see if our model is
more consistent for men or women. Are individuals within each group
being treated similarly? With the other metrics in mind we can determine
if they are being treated similarly unfairly or similarly fair. This
metric is calculated on a scale from 0 to 1 where a value of 1 means
completely consistent.

\hypertarget{in-and-post-processors}{%
\subsection{In and Post Processors}\label{in-and-post-processors}}

To account for any unfairness we find in the model we can use in and
post processing techniques.These techniques restructure the data and
reclassify observations in order to satisfy these metrics.

\textbf{Reweighing} Reweighting is a pre-processing technique which
assigns weights such that the protected attribute (gender) becomes
statistically independent from the outcome variable (access to emergency
funds). This means that after reweighting, knowing the gender of an
individual does not provide any information about whether or not the
individual has access. In mathematical terms, P(gender = male and access
= yes) = P(gender = male)*P(access = yes), and this equality holds true
for all gender-access combinations.

\textbf{Exponentiated Gradient Reduction}

The exponentiation gradient reduction is an in-processing optimization
approach. This processor aims to optimize both accuracy and fairness
focusing on demographic parity and equalized odds. The algorithm this
processor uses considers randomized classifiers and cost restraints to
find the optimal classifier that satisfies fairness restraints without
losing too much accuracy \citep{agarwal2018reductions}.

\textbf{Grid search Reduction}

Grid search reduction uses the cost restraint lamda to find a balance
between fairness and accuracy. This processor searches over a grid of
lamda values until the best value is found. This value is used in the
classifier to satisfy fairness and maximize accuracy. The grid search
reduction is useful for binary sensitive attributes and fairness metrics
with minimal constraints like demographic parity and equalized odds
\citep{agarwal2018reductions, agarwal2019fair}

\textbf{Calibrated Equalized Odds}

Calibrated equalized odds uses a post-processing technique that re
classifies values to satisfy the equalized odds metric while keeping the
classifier calibrated. A classifier is calibrated if the proportions of
positive and negative outcomes in the data match the probabilities
produced by the model. We want the calibration to hold across groups
such as male and female. This processor aims to satisfy an equalized
cost constraint while maintaining calibration
\citep{pleiss2017fairness}.

\textbf{Reject Option Classifier}

The reject option classifier is a post-processor that aims to reduce
discriminatory classifications based on the sensitive attribute. In our
case we aim to find a balance for predictions between males and females.
This classifier will relabel observations in a way that reduces
discrimination. More males will be relabeled with the unfavorable
outcome and more females will be relabeled with the favorable outcome
\citep{kamiran2012decision}.

\textbf{Meta Fair Classifier} The meta fair classifier creates a new
estimator but includes a reweighing pre-processing step
\citep{celis2019classification}. This classifier should be used as part
of a pipeline of steps. We must create a binary label data set. This
means that the data includes either a 1 representing access to emergency
funds or 0 for no access to emergency funds. This classifier aims to
transform the data in a way that will satisfy as many fairness metrics
as possible \citep{agarwal2018reductions}.
