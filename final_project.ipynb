        "\n",
        "* WHY was the dataset created?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Global Findex Database is one of the most comprehensive data sets on how adults save, borrow, make payments, and manage risk in more than 140 economies around the world. It was initially created in 2011 in order to measure financial inclusion and promote improvements in the same. It has been updated in 2014 and 2017. [Source](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/collections/global-findex)\n",
        "\n",
        "* WHAT was the purpose the dataset was created for? \n",
        "\n",
        "The main purpose the data set was created for was to record various measures of financial equity and inclusion such that the information can reveal opportunities to expand access to financial services and to promote greater use of digital financial services for folks who do not have a bank account.\n",
        "[Source](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/collections/global-findex) \n",
        "\n",
        " * Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?\n",
        "\n",
        "The documentation does not explicitly state tasks that the data should not be used for. One use I can think of that could be harmful is if credit card companies or other companies deciding whether or not to give folks loans used it to build a model to predict whether or not an individual would pay back a loan. This could be harmful because it could reinforce discrimination against poor people.\n",
        "\n",
        "* WHO created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization). Who funded the creation of the dataset? \n",
        "\n",
        "The data set was created by the Development Research Group, Finance and Private Sector Development Unit of [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex) with funding from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The survey was conducted by Gallup, Inc in association with the annual Gallup World Poll.\n",
        "\n",
        " * HOW can the owner/curator/manager of the dataset be contacted (e.g., email address)?\n",
        "\n",
        " I am not able to find an email address listed in the documentation or anywhere on the study website.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data?\n",
        "\n",
        "The participants responded to the questionnaire either on the phone or in-person, so it seems implied that they consented to data collection. It is unclear from the documentation whether or not the participants fully understood and consented to the publication and use of their data, although I imagine they may have signed a consent form before the interview.\n",

        "## Additional Questions\n",
        "      \n",
        "* Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? \n",
        " * If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample \n",
        "representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)?\n",
        "   * If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. \n",
        " * If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).\n",
        "\n",
        "* What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? "
